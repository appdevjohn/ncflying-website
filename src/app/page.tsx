        <h3>Aspiring for the Skies</h3>
        <p>
          At Triangle North, we&apos;re more than just a flying club; we&apos;re
          a community of aviation enthusiasts dedicated to making the joy of
          flying accessible and affordable. Our mission is simple: to provide
          pilots with the freedom to soar through the skies whenever they want,
          without the constraints of traditional clubs. While we&apos;re in the
          early stages of development and not yet operational, we&apos;re
          passionate about creating an aviation community where members can
          explore the skies affordably and freely.

        <h3>Fleet</h3>
        <p>
          While Triangle North Flying Club currently doesn&apos;t have aircraft,
          we&apos;re diligently preparing to introduce a diverse fleet featuring
          accessible and cost-effective options like Cessna 172s and Piper
          Cherokees. These airplanes don&apos;t require any special ratings or
          endorsements, so any private pilot can jump right in. Our commitment
          to full ownership and willingness to explore leaseback arrangements
          ensures that our aircraft remain readily available to members,
          supporting our vision of affordability and accessibility in aviation.
